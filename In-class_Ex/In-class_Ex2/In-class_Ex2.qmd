## 5.9 Spatially Constrained Clustering: ClustGeo Method

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using functions provided by **ClustGeo** package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.

### 5.9.1 Loading of packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(rgdal, spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, 
               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,
               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse)
```

### 5.9.2 Data import and preparation to obtain proximity matrix

The following code chunks are the required to obtain proximity matrix.

```{r}
shan_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                   layer = "myanmar_township_boundaries") %>%
  filter(ST %in% c("Shan (East)", "Shan (North)", "Shan (South)"))
```

```{r}
ict <- read_csv ("data/aspatial/Shan-ICT.csv")
```

```{r}
ict_derived <- ict %>%
  mutate(`RADIO_PR` = `Radio`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`TV_PR` = `Television`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`LLPHONE_PR` = `Land line phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`MPHONE_PR` = `Mobile phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`COMPUTER_PR` = `Computer`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`INTERNET_PR` = `Internet at home`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  rename(`DT_PCODE` =`District Pcode`,`DT`=`District Name`,
         `TS_PCODE`=`Township Pcode`, `TS`=`Township Name`,
         `TT_HOUSEHOLDS`=`Total households`,
         `RADIO`=`Radio`, `TV`=`Television`, 
         `LLPHONE`=`Land line phone`, `MPHONE`=`Mobile phone`,
         `COMPUTER`=`Computer`, `INTERNET`=`Internet at home`) 
```

```{r}
shan_sf <- left_join(shan_sf, 
                     ict_derived, 
                     by=c("TS_PCODE"="TS_PCODE"))
write_rds(shan_sf, "data/rds/shan_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
cluster_vars <- shan_sf %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  select("TS.x", "RADIO_PR", "TV_PR", "LLPHONE_PR", "MPHONE_PR", "COMPUTER_PR")
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

```{r}
row.names(cluster_vars) <- cluster_vars$"TS.x"
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

```{r}
shan_ict <- select(cluster_vars, c(2:6))
```

```{r}
proxmat <- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')
```

### 5.9.3 Ward-like hierarchical clustering: ClustGeo \# only works with Ward

ClustGeo package provides function called `hclustgeo()` to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like `hclust()` you learned in previous section.

To perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
nongeo_cluster <- hclustgeo(proxmat)
plot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)
rect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, 
            k = 6, 
            border = 2:5)
```

Note that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class `dist`, i.e.Â an object obtained with the function `dist()`. For sample code chunk, please refer to [5.7.6 Computing proximity matrix](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap05.html#computing-proximity-matrix) in hands on Ex3.

#### 5.9.3.1 Mapping the clusters formed

Similarly, we can plot the clusters on a categorical area shaded map by using the steps we learned in 5.7.12 Mapping the clusters formed.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(nongeo_cluster, k=6))
```

```{r}
shan_sf_ngeo_cluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)
```

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, "CLUSTER")
```

### 5.9.4 Spatially Constrained Hierarchical Clustering

Before we can performed spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, a spatial distance matrix will be derived by using [`st_distance()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_measures.html) of sf package.

```{r}
dist <- st_distance(shan_sf, shan_sf)
distmat <- as.dist(dist)
```

Notice that `as.dist()` is used to convert the data frame into matrix.

Next, `choicealpha()` will be used to determine a suitable value for the mixing parameter alpha as shown in the code chunk below. \# to balance attribute space vs spatial space. alpha value is from 0 to 1 (0 -attribute homogeneity , 1-spatial homogeneity), 2nd chart is the normalized one. use normalized if your distribution is skewed.

```{r}
cr <- choicealpha(proxmat, distmat, range.alpha = seq(0, 1, 0.1), K=6, graph = TRUE)
```

With reference to the graphs above, alpha = 0.3 will be used as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
clustG <- hclustgeo(proxmat, distmat, alpha = 0.3)
```

Next, `cutree()` is used to derive the cluster object.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(clustG, k=6))
```

We will then join back the group list with shan_sf polygon feature data frame by using the code chun below.

```{r}
shan_sf_Gcluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)
```

We can not plot the map of the newly delineated spatially constrained clusters.

to explain cluster, see how they are being plotted. visually-driven hierarchical clustering analysis ICT indicators

or do boxplots

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf_Gcluster, "CLUSTER")
```
